# Rent Price Prediction

This project aims to predict rent prices based on various factors such as area, location, number of rooms, and number of bathrooms. It utilizes machine learning techniques to build a predictive model.

## Objectives
1. Predictive Model: Develop a machine learning model to predict rent prices accurately.
2. Feature Importance: Determine which factors have the most significant impact on rent prices.
3. Deployment: Explore possibilities for deploying the model for real-time predictions.
